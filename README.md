This is about how you can use Google Colab as a free cloud server for torrent creation, upload, download and monitoring (With gigabyte speed up/down)


PROS

1. Very high speed U/D. More than 100 MB/s
2. Free and secure (google product)
3. Already added some util scripts to make the best use of it. Like automating most of the processes to be able to upload directly to TorrentBD.
4. Could be changed the scripts as your needs.
5. If you have "edu" google account (unlimited drive space) you can directly integrate your drive with a one liner config and directly mount the drive as folder.
etc.

CONS

1. 12 hours per day. (little more or less according to google's whim)
2. 30 mins of inactivity auto shuts down the server (the added scripts keeps it alive, discussed later)
3.  Disk is ephemeral. Meaning every time it's shut down, the data is gone (makes it mostly useful for only upload to TBD not seeding for long time). (edu google drive helps)
4. Not so user friendly, as the scripts are written by me and also it does not support GUI
etc.
5. No open ports
